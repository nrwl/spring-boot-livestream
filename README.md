## Development Setup

If you are using `VSCode`, and provided you have [Docker](https://docker.com) installed, then you can leverage its [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension, to easily setup you development environment, with everything needed already preinstalled (Java 17, Maven, Node + some useful VSCode extensions for Java).

Simply:

- Checkout the repo
- Open it with VSCode
- Open the "Commands prompt" and select "Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container..."
